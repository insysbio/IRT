I. INTRODUCTION
---------------
About IRT
  Immune Response Template (IRT) is a initiative project for a full cycle infrastructure for population, validation and visualization of the available data on immune cells and cytokine interactions in humans. The unique feature of the project is its focus on tools and support for QSP modeling by providing:
    - interactive schemes (passports of immune cells);
    - annotation of each process, cell and cytokine with cross references and links to the external databases;
    - rate equations of key processes involved in immune response derived on the basis of existing knowledge;
    - values of parameters of the rate equations identified via fitting of the specific sub-models to human in vitro and in vivo data;
    - extended annotation of rate equations and parameters;
    - automatic generation of QSP model templates.
  IRT team makes an effort in two direction: the development of database on human immune cells  interaction (IRT database) and the development of tools for navigation and model creation (IRT navigator).
